This folder contains the codes used for generation of all results in the draft paper NATCOMPUTSCI-20-0448A-Z

a) Generation of Figures 1 - 3:
	Codes required: ChirpbasedFRA.m
	How to run: Run the lines 1 to 20 in file 'Main' to generate the results for the system defined in 'sys'(Line 6). 
		    Type the desired transer function in 'sys' and choose the type of input chirp signal 
		    using 'ChirpIndex' (Line 16). Index 1 represents a linear chirp input signal, 2 represents an 
		    exponential chirp signal and Index 3 represents a fourth-order chirp signal. 
		    Frequency ranges are fixed as described in the paper and may be changed by changing
		    values of f0 (initial frequency) and f1 (final frequency) inside the code 'ChirpbasedFRA.m'.

b) Generation of Figure 4
	Codes required: Chirptf_final.m
                    sumofsines.m
	How to run: Run the lines 21 to 52 in file 'Main' for the desired system defined as a transfer function model in variable 'sys' (Line 27).
		    The two figures can be generated by setting the value of the variable 'tfinal' (Line 30) as 200 and 1000.  


c) Generation of Figure 5
	Codes required: peakdet.m
	Data required: HardwareData.mat
	How to run: Simply run lines 54 to 195 in file 'Main' to generate the results
